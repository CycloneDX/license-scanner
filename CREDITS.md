# IBM Donation to OWASP Foundation

The license-scanner was originally designed, created and solely developed by Priti Desai (pdesai@us.ibm.com) and Mark Sturdevant (mark.sturdevant@ibm.com) while working for IBM Corporation (http://www.ibm.com/) under an Apache 2 license and donated in January 2023 to the OWASP Foundation's CycloneDX project.

The license-scanner was created based on the prior works used internally at IBM. Acknowledging developers at IBM who established such foundation for license-scanner.
