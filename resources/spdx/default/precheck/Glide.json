    "preamble this license is for software that provides a 3d graphics application program interface (api).the license is intended to offer terms similar to some standard general public licenses designed to foster open standards and unrestricted accessibility to source code. some of these licenses require that,as a condition of the license of the software,any derivative works (that is,new software which is a work containing the original program or a portion of it) must be available for general use,without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee,and that the source code for such derivative works must likewise be made available. the only restriction is that such derivative works must be subject to the same general public license terms as the original work. this 3dfx glide source code general public license differs from the standard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire derivative work to be made available under the terms of this license nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for the entire derivative work. rather,the license is limited to only the identifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the licensed software. the precise terms and conditions for copying,distribution and modification follow.",
    "definitions",
    "this license applies to any program (or other 'work') which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 3dfx glide source code general public license.",

    "'modifications of the program' means any work,which includes a derivative work,and includes the whole of such work.",
    "'license' means this 3dfx glide source code general public license.",

    "the requirements of this section 3.2 do not apply to the modified work as a whole but only to the derivative work. it is not the intent of this license to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative works.",
