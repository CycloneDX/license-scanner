    "preamble the gnu general public license provides a legal guarantee that software covered by it remains free (in the sense of freedom,not price). it achieves this guarantee by imposing obligations on anyone who chooses to distribute the software. some of these obligations may be seen as unnecessarily burdensome. in particular,when the source code for the software is already publicly and freely available,there is minimal value in imposing upon each distributor the obligation to provide the complete source code (or an equivalent written offer to provide the complete source code). this license allows for the distribution of unmodified binaries built from publicly available source code,without imposing the obligations of the gnu general public license upon anyone who chooses to distribute only the unmodified binaries built from that source code. the extra permissions granted by this license apply only to unmodified binaries built from source code which has already been made available to the public in accordance with the terms of the gnu general public license. nothing in this license allows for the creation of closed-source modified versions of the program. any modified versions of the program are subject to the usual terms and conditions of the gnu general public license. terms and conditions for copying,distribution and modification this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this unmodified binary distribution license. all terms used in the text of this license are to be interpreted as they are used in version 2 of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation. if you have made this program available to the public in both source code and executable form in accordance with the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation; either version 2 of the license,or (at your option) any later version,then you are hereby granted an additional permission to use,copy,and distribute the unmodified executable form of this program (the 'unmodified binary') without restriction,including the right to permit persons to whom the unmodified binary is furnished to do likewise,subject to the following conditions:",
    "when started running,the program must display an announcement which includes the details of your existing publication of the program made in accordance with the terms of the gnu general public license. for example,the program could display the url of the publicly available source code from which the unmodified binary was built.",
    "when exercising your right to grant permissions under this license,you do not need to refer directly to the text of this license,but you may not grant permissions beyond those granted to you by this license."
