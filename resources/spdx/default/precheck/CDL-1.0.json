    "preamble. the common documentation license (cdl) provides a very simple and consistent license that allows relatively unrestricted use and redistribution of documents while still maintaining the author's credit and intent. to preserve simplicity,the license does not specify in detail how (e.g. font size) or where (e.g. title page,etc.) the author should be credited. to preserve consistency,changes to the cdl are not allowed and all derivatives of cdl documents are required to remain under the cdl. together,these constraints enable third parties to easily and safely reuse cdl documents,making the cdl ideal for authors who desire a wide distribution of their work. however,this means the cdl does not allow authors to restrict precisely how their work is used or represented,making it inappropriate for those desiring more finely-grained control.",
