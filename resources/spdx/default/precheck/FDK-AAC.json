    "introduction the fraunhofer fdk aac codec library for android ('fdk aac codec') is software that implements the mpeg advanced audio coding ('aac') encoding and decoding scheme for digital audio. this fdk aac codec software is intended to be used on a wide variety of android devices. aac's he-aac and he-aac v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient general perceptual audio codecs. aac-eld is considered the best-performing full-bandwidth communications codec by independent studies and is widely deployed. aac has been standardized by iso and iec as part of the mpeg specifications. patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the fdk aac codec (including those of fraunhofer) may be obtained through via licensing (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners individually for the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant with the iso/iec mpeg audio standards. please note that most manufacturers of android devices already license these patent claims through via licensing or directly from the patent owners,and therefore fdk aac codec software may already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those licensed purposes only. commercially-licensed aac software libraries,including floating-point versions with enhanced sound quality,are also available from fraunhofer. users are encouraged to check the fraunhofer website for additional applications information and documentation.",
