    "the software's interfaces may,to the extent permitted by the license of the other foss,be copied into,used and distributed in the other foss in order to enable interoperability,without requiring a change to the license of the other foss other than as to any interfaces of the software embedded therein. the software's interfaces remain at all times under the software license,including without limitation as used in the other foss (which upon any such use also then contains a portion of the software under the software license).",
